- **Collaboration and File Sharing**: CogniVault facilitates collaboration by allowing users to share files and directories with others securely. It supports different access levels, enabling users to grant read-only or read-write permissions to collaborators.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: CogniVault is designed to be compatible with multiple platforms and devices. It supports seamless synchronization and access to files across desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets, ensuring a consistent user experience.

## Data Structures

Choose appropriate data structures for your application based on its requirements. Evaluate different options considering factors such as efficient data retrieval, storage, search, and any specialized operations you need to support. Some considerations for data structure selection may include:

- B Tree:
  The B tree is a balanced tree data structure that provides efficient storage and retrieval of data. It is suitable for CogniVault as it offers fast data access, supports range queries, and enables efficient storage and retrieval of file and directory metadata. The balanced structure of the B tree ensures consistent access times, and its indexing capabilities facilitate quick navigation and retrieval of data based on keys.

- Trie:
  A trie data structure is well-suited for CogniVault's partial path matching and auto-complete functionality. It allows for efficient retrieval of paths based on partial matches, enabling quick suggestions and completion of file and directory paths as users type. The trie's structure represents the hierarchical structure of paths, making it efficient for navigation and searching based on prefixes.

- Dictionary:
  CogniVault can utilize a dictionary data structure to store properties associated with entities such as users, groups, files, and directories. A dictionary provides an efficient key-value storage mechanism, allowing for quick access and retrieval of properties based on entity objects. This data structure enables efficient storage and retrieval of metadata, permissions, timestamps, and other relevant information associated with each entity.

By combining the B tree, trie, and dictionary data structures, CogniVault can achieve efficient indexing and retrieval of file system entities, support auto-complete and partial path matching for enhanced user experience, and enable efficient storage and retrieval of entity properties.


## Data Structure Evaluation

When selecting data structures for CogniVault, it's important to consider the pros and cons of each option. Here's an evaluation of the chosen data structures:

### B-Tree

**Pros:**
- Efficient indexing: The B-tree provides efficient indexing and retrieval of key-value pairs, enabling fast data access based on keys.
- Range queries: B-trees are well-suited for operations that involve retrieving a range of files or directories based on their keys, thanks to their balanced structure and key sorting.
- Balanced structure: B-trees maintain a balanced structure, ensuring consistent access times regardless of the size of the file system.
- Disk-friendly: B-trees optimize disk I/O operations by minimizing the number of disk reads or writes required to access or modify data.

**Cons:**
- Complexity: Implementing and managing a B-tree can be more complex compared to simpler data structures.
- Additional overhead: B-trees may require additional overhead in terms of memory usage compared to some other data structures.
- Limited sequential access: Unlike B+ trees, B-trees do not provide built-in support for efficient sequential access.

### Trie

**Pros:**
- Partial path matching: Tries are well-suited for CogniVault's auto-complete and partial path matching functionality, allowing efficient retrieval of paths based on partial matches.
- Quick suggestions: Tries enable quick suggestions and completion of file and directory paths as users type.
- Efficient navigation: The hierarchical structure of tries facilitates efficient navigation and searching based on prefixes.

**Cons:**
- Increased memory usage: Tries can consume more memory compared to some other data structures, especially for large datasets with high path diversity.
- Limited use case: Tries are primarily suited for string-related operations and may have specific benefits for certain functionalities within CogniVault.

### Dictionary

**Pros:**
- Efficient property storage: Dictionaries provide efficient key-value storage for entity properties associated with users, groups, files, and directories in the file system. This allows for quick and direct access to entity properties based on their associated keys.
- Quick access: Dictionary lookups have a constant time complexity, providing fast access to entity properties based on entity objects. This makes it efficient for retrieving and manipulating metadata and other attributes of file system entities.

**Cons:**
- Limited indexing: Dictionaries are not specifically designed for efficient searching or sorting based on keys. While dictionaries offer fast access to values based on their keys, if you need to perform advanced queries or search operations based on properties, additional data structures may be required to create suitable indices or support more complex search patterns.
- Lack of ordered traversal: Dictionaries do not inherently maintain a specific order for their keys or values. If ordered traversal or iteration over the keys or values in a specific order is a requirement, additional operations or data structures may be necessary.

When considering the use of a dictionary in the file system, its efficient key-value storage and quick access to entity properties make it suitable for managing metadata and attributes associated with files, directories, users, and groups. However, if you require more advanced querying capabilities or ordered traversal of keys or values, you may need to consider alternative data structures or additional indexing mechanisms.


## File System Design with B Tree, Trie, and Dictionary

### B Tree for Entity Management

- Use a B tree to store entities such as users, groups, files, and directories in the file system.
- Each entity is associated with a unique identifier (e.g., UUID).
- The B tree allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations based on the unique identifiers.
- Each node of the B tree stores the entity identifier and a reference to the corresponding entity object.

### Trie for Auto-Complete and Partial Path Matching

- Use a trie data structure to support auto-complete and efficient partial path matching for directories and file paths.
- Store the paths as strings in the trie, with each character representing a node in the trie.
- Each node in the trie contains references to child nodes representing the subsequent characters in the path.

### Entity Properties Dictionary

- For each entity (user, group, file, directory), maintain a dictionary that stores properties specific to that entity.
- The properties dictionary can be implemented as a separate data structure, such as a hash table or a key-value store, associated with each entity object.

### Benefits of the Combined Approach

- Efficient Entity Management: The B tree allows efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of entities based on unique identifiers. It provides fast access to entity objects.
- Auto-Complete and Partial Path Matching: The trie structure enables auto-complete and efficient partial path matching for directories and file paths. It assists in quickly suggesting and completing paths as users type.
- Property Storage: The entity properties dictionary provides a convenient way to store and retrieve the specific properties associated with each entity. It allows efficient access to the properties based on the entity object.

By combining the B tree for entity management, trie for auto-complete and partial path matching, and entity properties dictionary, you can achieve the benefits of efficient entity management, auto-complete functionality, and property storage in the file system design.
