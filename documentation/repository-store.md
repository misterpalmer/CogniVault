# Store vs Repository

The terms "store" and "repository" are often used interchangeably, but in certain contexts, they imply specific design considerations or patterns. Here's a breakdown:

## Repository

### Definition
A Repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection. It provides methods to retrieve domain objects based on certain criteria and can also save domain objects back to the data store.

### Responsibilities
- Repository isolates the domain layer from details of data access.
- It often provides an API that's in terms of domain-specific objects or domain primitive types. So, instead of querying by table and column names, you might query by business-specific criteria.
- It encapsulates the logic required to obtain and store domain objects.

### Typical Use
Often used in Domain-Driven Design and in applications that emphasize domain-centric or domain-rich designs.

### Example
A `UserRepository` might have methods like `FindById`, `FindByUsername`, `Add`, and `Remove`.

## Store

### Definition
The term "store" is more generic and could be thought of as a place where data or objects are held and can be retrieved from. It might or might not encapsulate any domain logic.

### Responsibilities
- Typically provides a simpler API compared to repositories.
- Focused more on the mechanics of storing and retrieving objects or data rather than the business or domain logic.
- Often, the terms "cache" or "store" can be used interchangeably.

### Typical Use
A store might be used for caching, configuration storage, or simpler use cases where the overhead and complexity of a repository aren't needed.

### Example
A `UserTokenStore` might simply have methods like `GetToken` and `StoreToken` without any other logic around token validity or business-specific logic.

## Key Distinctions

### Complexity & Scope
- A repository usually has a broader scope than a store. A repository might interface with a database, have query methods, and encapsulate more complex domain logic.
- A store is often simpler and might be closer to a basic key-value interface.

### Purpose
- Repositories are primarily used for abstracting and encapsulating data access and domain logic.
- Stores might be used for caching, temporary storage, or other similar purposes.

### Data vs. Domain Focus
- Repositories are typically domain-centric, working with domain entities or aggregates.
- Stores might be more data-centric or even format-centric.

### Level of Abstraction
- Repositories often act as an abstraction layer over the underlying data access mechanism, allowing you to change or swap out data sources without altering domain code.
- Stores might be less abstract or might be abstracted differently, focusing on the storage mechanism itself.

In practice, the distinction between a store and a repository can be blurry, and the terms might be used differently based on the context or the specific technology stack. But, as a general guideline, repositories tend to be more complex and domain-focused, while stores are simpler and more data-focused.




## Repository vs. Store

The distinction between a "repository" and a "store" often boils down to the intent and the level of abstraction that each provides, especially in the context of domain-driven design (DDD). Let's break it down in relation to the `InMemoryUserRepository`:

### Business Domain Focus:
- **Repository**: 
  - The `InMemoryUserRepository` is tailored around the domain entity `User`. Its methods (`GetByIdAsync`, `GetByUsernameAsync`, etc.) are defined based on what makes sense in the context of user operations within the business domain. It doesn't just provide a generic interface to add or get items based on a key.
- **Store**: 
  - A store typically focuses more on the mechanics of storing and retrieving data. It might not encapsulate or be aware of business-specific operations.

### Abstraction Level:
- **Repository**: 
  - A repository abstracts the underlying storage mechanism and provides operations in terms of the domain model, such as a `User` in this case. When you retrieve a user by username using the repository, you're not concerned with _how_ it fetches the user; you're only concerned with _what_ it does (i.e., get me the user with this username).
- **Store**: 
  - A store would be closer to the mechanics, perhaps offering methods like `Add`, `Get`, `Delete` based purely on keys, without any special methods that reflect domain-specific operations.

### Responsibility and Encapsulation:
- **Repository**: 
  - The repository might contain business rules or domain logic, even if it's just related to data retrieval or persistence. In our example, `IsValidUserCredentialsAsync` encapsulates the rule of matching a username with a password.
- **Store**: 
  - A store would typically lack such encapsulation. If you wanted to check if a user's credentials are valid with a store, you might have to fetch the user's data from the store and then externally match it against the provided credentials.

### Interchangeability:
- **Repository**: 
  - If in the future, you decide to switch from an in-memory storage to a relational database for user data, the repository provides an abstraction layer that allows you to make that switch with minimal changes to the calling code. You'd implement a new repository (e.g., `SqlUserRepository`) while ensuring it adheres to the same `IUserRepository` interface.
- **Store**: 
  - Transitioning from one storage mechanism to another might require significant changes at the call sites, since a store might expose more of the underlying mechanics to its consumers.

In essence, while the `InMemoryUserRepository` could potentially be labeled as a "store" due to its straightforward in-memory storage mechanism, it's the design considerations and the way the class interfaces with the domain that align it more with the repository pattern. The repository pattern brings the data-related operations closer to the domain model, abstracting away the details of the data source.
