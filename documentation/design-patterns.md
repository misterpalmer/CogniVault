A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It's not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Using design patterns promotes reusability, which leads to more robust and maintainable code.

There are three types of design patterns:

- **Structural Patterns:** These deal with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships among entities.
- **Creational Patterns:** These deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
- **Behavioral Patterns:** These deal with communication between objects, how they interact and fulfill their duties.

Examples of design patterns include the Singleton, Factory, Facade, Observer, Strategy, and Composite patterns among many others. Each of these patterns represents a best practice used by experienced object-oriented software developers. They were popularized in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by the Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides).
