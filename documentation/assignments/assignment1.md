## Assignment - File System

Explain the data structures and algorithms that you would use to design an in-memory file system (Similar to *nix systems). Illustrate with an example in code where possible. Your design must include the following concepts: Directory, File, User, and Permissions. Please note there can be other concepts in your design, but these ones are required.

Use cases that must be supported by your design:

1. Machine Startup & File System instantiation
2. Access to all the files and directories via an access path
3. Setting permissions and reading permissions
4. Creating/Reading/Updating/Deleting a Directory or a File

## Rubric:

- Complete class structure (1 point)
- Relationships between classes (1 point)
- Appropriate class variables to store the file system details (1 point)
- Appropriate methods signatures in the classes that support the following use cases (2 points)
