The design of an in-memory file system involves the use of several key data structures and algorithms. The primary data structure would be a tree, where each node could either represent a file or a directory. This tree structure reflects the hierarchical nature of a file system.

Below, I will detail a basic design, using C# as the implementation language.

Here are the key entities:

Directory: This class represents a directory in the filesystem. It contains a name, a list of subdirectories, a list of files, the owner (user), and the permissions.

File: This class represents a file in the filesystem. It contains a name, content, the owner (user), and the permissions.

User: This class represents a user who can own files and directories.

Permissions: This class represents the permissions of a file or directory. It includes Read, Write, and Execute permissions.
